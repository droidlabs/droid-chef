h1. Chef Backup

A cookbook for adding offsite backups to your webserver. Installs all the gems necessary.
Requires a bit of pre-configuration before running the cookbook.

Assumes database and directory backup, with an s3sync to an amazon s3 bucket.

* You need to create the bucket on s3. (currently set to us-east-1 region)
* Copy amazon access keys to ~/.aws/secret_key and ~/.aws/access_key
* Database passwords
* Directories to sync.

You should be familiar with the "backup gem":https://github.com/meskyanichi/backup 

Note: This cookbook is in early stages so improvements and contributions are encouraged!

h2. Installation

I recommend "knife github cookbooks":https://github.com/websterclay/knife-github-cookbooks for installing this cookbook into your chef repository.
